# 3D-Portfolio-2023
A 3D portfiolio example used to apply concepts commonly found in 3D websites built with ThreeJS

------------------------------------------------------------
# How it works:

The 3D portfolio webpage can be experienced locally by:
  1. downloading the repository
  2. run npm install (with npm for NodeJS)
  3. visit localhost:3000

The page includes functionality such as
  - Scrolling along a track with the mouse wheel
  - Tilting the camera to follow the mouse
  - Moving the camera to a new position, and focus on an object, when the object is clicked.
  - Animating an object after a click

------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to apply a variety of concepts associated with ThreeJS and 3D software in a single project. 
Below is a variety of concepts covered, as well as videos covering them in more detail:
